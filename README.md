***AWS S3 Static Website Deployment using Terraform**

**Overview**

This project uses Terraform to provision an AWS S3 bucket configured as a static website. It includes bucket policies, access control configurations, and automated file uploads to host a static website.

**Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:
Terraform (latest version recommended)
AWS CLI (configured with valid credentials)
An AWS account with permissions to create and manage S3 buckets

**Project Structure**

â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf               # Terraform configuration for S3 bucket & policies                                             
â”œâ”€â”€ variables.tf          # Variables for bucket configuration                                         
â”œâ”€â”€ outputs.tf            # Outputs such as the website URL

ðŸ”§ Usage

Initialize Terraform:
```sh
terraform init
```
Plan Deployment:
```sh
terraform plan
 ```
Apply Changes:
```sh
terraform apply -auto-approve
 ```
Destroy Resources:
```sh
terraform destroy -auto-approve
 ```

**Troubleshooting**

**1. Access Denied Errors**

Ensure your AWS IAM user has s3:PutBucketPolicy, s3:PutObject, and s3:GetObject permissions.
Update the bucket policy manually if needed.

**2. Website Not Loading**

Check if the S3 bucket has static website hosting enabled.
Ensure the index.html file is uploaded correctly.
Verify that the public access settings allow object retrieval.
